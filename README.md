# Quantium Task 1

# Project Description
In this project, I worked on Quantium Task 1 as part of the Data Analytics Virtual Internship. The goal was to explore and analyze retail transaction data to extract actionable insights for the business.

# Task Alloted
Examine transaction data – look for inconsistencies, missing data across the data set, outliers, correctly identified category items, numeric data across all tables. If you determine any anomalies make the necessary changes in the dataset and save it. Having clean data will help when it comes to your analysis. 

Examine customer data – check for similar issues in the customer data, look for nulls and when you are happy merge the transaction and customer data together so it’s ready for the analysis ensuring you save your files along the way.

Data analysis and customer segments – in your analysis make sure you define the metrics – look at total sales, drivers of sales, where the highest sales are coming from etc. Explore the data, create charts and graphs as well as noting any interesting trends and/or insights you find. These will all form part of our report to Julia. 

Deep dive into customer segments – define your recommendation from your insights, determine which segments we should be targeting, if packet sizes are relative and form an overall conclusion based on your analysis. 

# What I Did
Simple Text Analysis - Performed basic text analysis on product names/descriptions to extract useful information (e.g., simplifying Brand Name).
Feature Engineering - Created new feature for better understanding the customer and transaction data to draw meaning insights.
Data Visualization - Visualized trends using bar charts, treemaps, and other graphical tools to effectively communicate insights.
Affinity Analysis - Analyzed brand affinity to understand customer preferences across different brands and pack sizes on target segments.
